webapp for managing economics, time and location of stuff around the home to ease the daily grind in the family

this is mainly an app for managing family economics and stuff around the house.
it came to thought after one year apart and then coming together again with insights of what need to be changed.

it is thought out to circle around microsofts eco-system.
so i have made a personal azure where this app is registered.
we can then login with our respective m365 users.
the app pulls data from csv-files located in a shared OneDrive folder.
the access is granted to my spouce and our oldest daughter.

the app is under construction.
